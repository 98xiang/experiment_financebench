Give a response to the question by relying on the details shown in the cash flow statement.,$1577.00,"The FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M, as indicated in the cash flow statement, is the amount spent on purchases of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). For 2018, this amount is reported as:

**Purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E): $(1,577) million.**

Thus, the capital expenditure amount for FY2018 is **$1,577 million**.",[]
1,openai,gpt-4o-mini,oracle,0.01,512,financebench_id_04672,Assume that you are a public equities analyst. Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the balance sheet: what is the year end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M? Answer in USD billions.,$8.70,"To determine the year-end FY2018 net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPNE) for 3M, we can refer to the relevant section of the balance sheet provided.

From the balance sheet:

- Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) at cost: $24,873 million
- Less: Accumulated depreciation: $(16,135) million

To calculate the net PP&E, we subtract the accumulated depreciation from the total PP&E:

Net PP&E = Total PP&E - Accumulated Depreciation  
Net PP&E = $24,873 million - $16,135 million  
Net PP&E = $8,738 million

To convert this amount into billions, we divide by 1,000:

Net PPNE = $8,738 million / 1,000 = $8.738 billion

Thus, the year-end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M is **$8.738 billion**.",[]
2,openai,gpt-4o-mini,oracle,0.01,512,financebench_id_00499,Is 3M a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?,"No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:
CAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%
Fixed assets/Total Assets: 20%
Return on Assets= 12.4%","To determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, we can analyze the company's financial statements, particularly focusing on its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and capital expenditures.

1. **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: As of December 31, 2022, 3M reported net PP&E of $9,178 million. This indicates a significant investment in physical assets, which is a characteristic of capital-intensive businesses.

2. **Capital Expenditures**: In the cash flow statement, 3M reported purchases of property, plant, and equipment amounting to $1,749 million for FY2022. This level of capital expenditure further supports the notion that 3M invests heavily in its physical assets.

3. **Comparison to Other Expenses**: The cost of sales for 3M in FY2022 was $19,232 million, while operating expenses totaled $27,690 million. The substantial portion of costs attributed to PP&E and the ongoing investment in capital assets relative to total expenses indicates a capital-intensive nature.

4. **Industry Context**: 3M operates in various sectors, including industrial, safety, and consumer products, which typically require significant capital investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that 3M is indeed a capital-intensive business, as evidenced by its substantial investments in property, plant, and equipment, as well as its significant capital expenditures in FY2022.",[]
3,openai,gpt-4o-mini,oracle,0.01,512,financebench_id_01226,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The operating margin change for 3M in FY2022 was primarily driven by several factors related to both operating expenses and special items. The operating income margin decreased from 20.8% in 2021 to 19.1% in 2022, reflecting a decline of 1.7 percentage points. 

### Key Drivers of Operating Margin Change:

1. **Cost of Sales**: The cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 53.2% in 2021 to 56.2% in 2022, a rise of 3.0 percentage points. This increase was attributed to:
   - Special item costs related to significant litigation, particularly concerning PFAS-related matters.
   - Higher raw materials and logistics costs.
   - Manufacturing productivity challenges, exacerbated by the shutdown of operations in Belgium and the restart of previously-idled operations.
   - Investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability initiatives.

2. **Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)**: SG&A expenses also increased significantly, from 20.4% in 2021 to 26.5% in 2022, a rise of 6.1 percentage points. This increase was driven by:
   - Increased special item costs for litigation, particularly related to the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation.
   - Impairment costs associated with exiting PFAS manufacturing.
   - Costs related to exiting operations in Russia and restructuring charges from divestitures.
   - Continued investment in growth initiatives, although these were partially offset by restructuring benefits and cost management efforts.

3. **Research and Development (R&D)**: R&D expenses slightly decreased as a percentage of sales, from 5.6% in 2021 to 5.4% in 2022. While this decrease did not significantly impact the overall operating margin, it indicates a continued focus on innovation despite the overall margin decline.

4. **Special Items**: The gain on business divestitures, specifically the $2.7 billion pre-tax gain from the split-off of the Food Safety business, positively impacted the financials but was not included in the operating margin calculation. Conversely, the goodwill impairment expense related to exiting PFAS manufacturing negatively affected the overall financial performance.

### Conclusion:
Operating margin is a useful metric for 3M, as it provides insight into the company's operational efficiency and cost management relative to its sales. However, it is important to consider the impact of special items and one-time costs, such as litigation and divestitures",[]

5,openai,gpt-4o-mini,oracle,0.01,512,financebench_id_00807,"Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark","To assess 3M's liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023, we first need to calculate the quick ratio using the relevant figures from the balance sheet.

The quick ratio is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventories} - \text{Prepaid Expenses}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
\]

From the provided balance sheet data:

- **Current Assets**: $15,754 million
- **Inventories**: $5,280 million
- **Prepaid Expenses**: $674 million
- **Current Liabilities**: $10,936 million

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

1. Calculate the liquid assets (current assets minus inventories and prepaid expenses):

\[
\text{Liquid Assets} = 15,754 - 5,280 - 674 = 9,800 \text{ million}
\]

2. Now, calculate the quick ratio:

\[
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{9,800}{10,936} \approx 0.897
\]

A quick ratio of approximately 0.897 indicates that 3M has less than one dollar in liquid assets for every dollar of current liabilities. Generally, a quick ratio below 1.0 suggests that a company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations without selling inventory or obtaining additional financing.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculated quick ratio of approximately 0.897, 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, as it indicates potential challenges in covering its current liabilities with its most liquid assets.",[]

Base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the statement of income and the statement of financial position.,24.26,"To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard for FY2019, we will use the formula:

\[
\text{Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{FY2019 Revenue}}{\text{Average PP&E}}
\]

1. **Determine FY2019 Revenue**:
   From the consolidated statements of operations, the total net revenues for FY2019 is:
   \[
   \text{FY2019 Revenue} = 6,489 \text{ million}
   \]

2. **Determine Average PP&E**:
   We need to find the average Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) between FY2018 and FY2019. The PP&E values are:
   - At December 31, 2019: \( 253 \text{ million} \)
   - At December 31, 2018: \( 282 \text{ million} \)

   The average PP&E is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Average PP&E} = \frac{\text{PP&E}_{2019} + \text{PP&E}_{2018}}{2} = \frac{253 + 282}{2} = \frac{535}{2} = 267.5 \text{ million}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio**:
   Now we can substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{6,489}{267.5} \approx 24.24
   \]

4. **Round to Two Decimal Places**:
   The fixed asset turnover ratio rounded to two decimal places is:
   \[
   \text{Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio} \approx 24.24

   - Total Capex = FY2019 + FY2018 + FY2017
     \[
     = -116 + (-131) + (-155) = -402 \text{ million}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average capex as a percentage of revenue**:
   - Average Capex = Total Capex / Total Revenues
     \[
     = \frac{-402}{20,006} \approx -0.0201

A drop by 2.2% in a year.,"To determine whether Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, we can calculate the operating margin for the years provided and analyze the trend.

**Operating Margin Calculation:**
Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by total revenue.

1. **FY2022:**
   - Operating Income: $6,098 million
   - Total Revenue: $17,606 million
   - Operating Margin = \( \frac{6,098}{17,606} \approx 34.6\% \)

2. **FY2021:**
   - Operating Income: $5,802 million
   - Total Revenue: $15,785 million
   - Operating Margin = \( \frac{5,802}{15,785} \approx 36.8\% \)

3. **FY2020:**
   - Operating Income: $4,237 million
   - Total Revenue: $12,868 million
   - Operating Margin = \( \frac{4,237}{12,868} \approx 32.9\% \)

**Operating Margin Trend:**
- FY2020: 32.9%
- FY2021: 36.8%
- FY2022: 34.6%

From the calculations, we can see that Adobe's operating margin increased from FY2020 to FY2021 but then decreased from FY2021 to FY2022. Therefore, while the operating margin improved from FY2020 to FY2021, it did not continue to improve in FY2022.

**Conclusion:**
Adobe does not have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, as the operating margin decreased from FY2021 to FY2022. 

**Relevance of Operating Margin:**
Operating margin can be a useful metric for evaluating companies, particularly those in traditional manufacturing or service industries. However, for a company like Adobe, which operates primarily in the software and technology sector, other metrics such as gross margin, net income, and cash flow may provide more insight into its financial health and operational efficiency. This is because software companies often have high fixed costs and low variable costs, leading to different dynamics in profitability compared to companies with more variable cost structures.",[]
