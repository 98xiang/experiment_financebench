3,openai,gpt-4o-mini,sharedStore,0.01,512,financebench_id_01226,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The operating margin change for 3M in FY2022 was driven by several factors, including increases in raw materials, logistics, and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs. Additionally, there were impacts from manufacturing productivity, increased compensation and benefit costs, which more than offset the leverage from sales growth and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges.

Operating margin can be a useful metric for a company like 3M, as it provides insight into the efficiency of the company's operations and its ability to manage costs relative to its sales. However, it is important to consider that operating margin may not capture all aspects of a company's financial health, especially in a diversified global manufacturer like 3M, where different segments may have varying cost structures and profitability profiles. Therefore, while operating margin is a relevant measure, it should be analyzed alongside other financial metrics and qualitative factors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's performance.","[Document(metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': ""D:20230208130417-05'00'"", 'creationdate': '2023-02-08T13:04:17-05:00', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5', 'file_path': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//3M_2022_10K.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': '', 'moddate': '', 'page': 18, 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'source': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//3M_2022_10K.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': '10-K - 02/08/2023 - 3M Company', 'total_pages': 252, 'trapped': ''}, page_content=""Additional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” sections in 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 26, 2022 (which updated 3M's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOVERVIEW\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services.

Base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the statement of income and the statement of financial position.,24.26,"To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard for FY2019, we need the revenue for FY2019 and the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) between FY2018 and FY2019.

1. **Revenue for FY2019**: The revenue is not explicitly provided in the information given, so I cannot determine this value.

2. **Average PP&E**:
   - PP&E at December 31, 2018: $282 million
   - PP&E at December 31, 2019: $253 million
   - Average PP&E = (PP&E at end of FY2018 + PP&E at end of FY2019) / 2
   - Average PP&E = ($282 million + $253 million) / 2 = $267.5 million

11,openai,gpt-4o-mini,sharedStore,0.01,512,financebench_id_07507,What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we can use the operating income figures from the consolidated statements of income.

Operating income for FY2015: $1,493,602,000  
Operating income for FY2016: $2,168,095,000  

Now, we can calculate the change in operating income:

Change in operating income = Operating income FY2016 - Operating income FY2015  
Change in operating income = $2,168,095,000 - $1,493,602,000  
Change in operating income = $674,493,000  

Next, we calculate the year-over-year change in percentage:

Year-over-year change (%) = (Change in operating income / Operating income FY2015) * 100  
Year-over-year change (%) = ($674,493,000 / $1,493,602,000) * 100  
Year-over-year change (%) ≈ 45.1%

Therefore, the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is approximately 45.1%.","[Document(metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:20160212085500Z', 'creationdate': '2016-02-12T08:55:00+00:00', 'creator': '', 'file_path': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': ""D:20160212090055-08'00'"", 'moddate': '2016-02-12T09:00:55-08:00', 'page': 59, 'producer': 'WebFilings', 'source': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'ADBE 10K FY15', 'total_pages': 116, 'trapped': ''}, page_content='60\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n \nYears Ended\n \nNovember 27,\n2015\nNovember 28,\n2014\nNovember 29,\n2013\nRevenue:\n \nSubscription.............................................................................................. $\n3,223,904\n$\n2,076,584\n$\n1,137,856\nProduct......................................................................................................\n1,125,146\n1,627,803\n2,470,098\nServices and support.................................................................................\n446,461\n442,678\n447,286\nTotal revenue........................................................................................\n4,795,511\n4,147,065\n4,055,240\n \nCost of revenue:\nSubscription..............................................................................................\n409,194\n335,432\n278,077\nProduct......................................................................................................\n90,035\n97,099\n138,154'), Document(metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:201801221048', 'creationdate': 'D:201801221048', 'creator': '', 'file_path': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': '', 'moddate': '', 'page': 57, 'producer': 'WebFilings', 'source': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'ADBE 10K FY17', 'total_pages': 107, 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Table of Contents\n58\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n \nYears Ended\n \nDecember 1,\n2017\nDecember 2,\n2016\nNovember 27,\n2015\nRevenue:\n \nSubscription\n$\n6,133,869\n$\n4,584,833\n$\n3,223,904\nProduct\n706,767\n800,498\n1,125,146\nServices and support\n460,869\n469,099\n446,461\nTotal revenue\n7,301,505\n5,854,430\n4,795,511\n \nCost of revenue:\nSubscription\n623,048\n461,860\n409,194\nProduct\n57,082\n68,917\n90,035\nServices and support\n330,361\n289,131\n245,088\nTotal cost of revenue\n1,010,491\n819,908\n744,317\n \nGross profit\n6,291,014\n5,034,522\n4,051,194\n \nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n1,224,059\n975,987\n862,730\nSales and marketing\n2,197,592\n1,910,197\n1,683,242\nGeneral and administrative\n624,706\n576,202\n533,478\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n76,562\n78,534\n68,649\nTotal operating expenses\n4,122,919\n3,540,920\n3,148,099\n \nOperating income\n2,168,095\n1,493,602\n903,095\n \nNon-operating income (expense):\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n36,395\n13,548\n33,909'), Document(metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': 'D:20170120111800Z', 'creationdate': '2017-01-20T11:18:00+00:00', 'creator': '', 'file_path': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': ""D:20170120112323-08'00'"", 'moddate': '2017-01-20T11:23:23-08:00', 'page': 61, 'producer': 'WebFilings', 'source': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': 'ADBE 10K FY16 -
