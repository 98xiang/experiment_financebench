If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The operating margin change for 3M in FY2022 was driven by several factors, including increases in raw materials, logistics, and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs, as well as manufacturing productivity impacts and increased compensation and benefit costs. These factors more than offset the leverage from sales growth and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges.

Operating margin can be a useful metric for a company like 3M, as it provides insight into the efficiency of the company's operations and its ability to generate profit from its sales. However, it is important to consider that operating margin may not capture all aspects of a company's financial performance, especially in a diversified global manufacturer like 3M, where different segments may have varying cost structures and profitability profiles. Therefore, while operating margin is a relevant metric, it should be analyzed in conjunction with other financial indicators and contextual factors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's performance.","[Document(metadata={'author': '', 'creationDate': ""D:20230208130417-05'00'"", 'creationdate': '2023-02-08T13:04:17-05:00', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5', 'file_path': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//3M_2022_10K.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'keywords': '', 'modDate': '', 'moddate': '', 'page': 18, 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'source': 'c:\\Users\\ke223\\OneDrive\\文件\\side_project_financebench\\financebench/pdfs//3M_2022_10K.pdf', 'subject': '', 'title': '10-K - 02/08/2023 - 3M Company', 'total_pages': 252, 'trapped': ''}, page_content=""Additional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” sections in 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 26, 2022 (which updated 3M's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOVERVIEW\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services.

Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we can use the operating income figures from the consolidated statements of income.

Operating income for FY2015: $903,095,000  
Operating income for FY2016: $1,493,602,000  

Now, we can calculate the change in operating income:

Change in operating income = Operating income FY2016 - Operating income FY2015  
Change in operating income = $1,493,602,000 - $903,095,000  
Change in operating income = $590,507,000  

Next, we calculate the year-over-year percentage change:

Percentage change = (Change in operating income / Operating income FY2015) * 100  
Percentage change = ($590,507,000 / $903,095,000) * 100  
Percentage change ≈ 65.4%

Operating margin can be a useful metric for a company like Adobe, as it reflects the efficiency of the company in managing its operating expenses relative to its revenue.
